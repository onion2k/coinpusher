# Vibe Code

This app was _mostly_ vibe coded in about 40 minutes, using GPT5-Codex and the series of prompts in prompts.md. I didn't touch the code until it came to some manual tweaking to get things working better at the end (moving pusher blocks, changing the scale of things, changing the speed the platforms move at). I didn't need to touch any if the code; I only changed constants.

# Next steps

It needs to be a proper game with some interactivity. It needs to look nicer.
